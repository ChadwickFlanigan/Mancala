        <h3>From the Dawn of Time...</h3>
        <p>
            Archealogical evidence places the game of Mancala at atleast two thousand years old, with roots stretching back into the misty past of the horn of Africa. There, 
            around the land that would one day be called Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, it is believed that Arabic traders brought with them the core aspects of the game that 
            would become Mancala. Today, there are atleast 200 variations of the game across Africa, and across the globe as a whole. 
        </p>
        <h3>To the New World</h3>
        <p>
            Given the popularity of the game of Mancala, it was inevitable that the people sold into slavery via the trans-atlantic slave trade would create anew the games 
            they played in their homelands. It is largely due to these roots that Mancala has such a strong presence on the North American continent, given that Mancala never 
            gained the traction in medieval and early-modern Europe that it had elsewhere.
            <br>
            <br>
            The first commercial version of Mancala was published in the United States in 1891 by the Milton Bradley Company under the name of Chuba, emphasizing the African 
            roots of the game.
