        <h2>Mancala!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the exciting world of Mancala, a game that has, some experts say, been played since the dawn of time! The earliest archealogical evidence that
            we are aware of for the game of Mancala (which has been known by many other names through the years) places it firmly in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE; however,
            absence of evidence is not evidence of abscence. Given the game's widespread use across the world and the wide variety of archealogical findings that could
            be attributed and described as what we may call mancala, many believe it safe to assume that mancala is even older than evidence would have us believe. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So what is it about Mancala that people across the globe have found enjoyment in for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years? What is Mancala anyway? 
        </p>
        <h4>Mancala: a Game or a Ruleset?</h4>
        <p>
            To explain Mancala's prolific presence across the world, it may be easier to think of Mancala as, not a game, but a set of rules to move stones (or beans, 
            seeds, grass stalks, or whatever else can be found) across a board with a set number of divets. The game pieces (the stones or whatever else) are placed equitably
            across the holes. One player is assigned to one of the two sides, with a central divet on either side of the board designated as the score cup. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When the players are ready, one person chooses one of the divets from which to begin. They will pick up the pieces and, going clockwise, distribute one stone into each 
            proceeding divet. When the player has run out of stones, their turn is over; however, if their last stone falls into their score divet, they may choose another divet 
            and continue playing. If the last stone falls into an empty divet, then the player captures their oppenents stones sitting opposite of that empty divet.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is but one way to play the adamantine game of Mancala. The method described above is most common in the United States, but even there diferring rules can be found 
            state to state and home to home. Explore this website more to learn more about the exciting and traditional game of Mancala!
