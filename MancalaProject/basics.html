        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>
            So you've made it this far! The alure of moving stones around a wooden board has proven enticing enough to make you click on a second page of a website dedicated to a game 
            so materially bereft that it could be found in a church mouse's studio apartment. Sure, the place might smell dingy and the sink is held up by a singular rusted nut, but 
            at least there's entertainment!
            <br>
            <br>
            When you get tired of rock-paper-scissors, it's time to move over the Mancala, a game perhaps as equally engaging. Here are the basics:
        </p>
        <h5>Setup</h5>
        <p>
            If the aforementioned mouse does not have a mancala board, you're in luck! A handy egg carton will do; it's nifty set of 12 holes make is perfect for playing with 
            our form of mancala. Place in each of the 12 holes 4 stone pieces, or scraps of left-over cheese wrapping, whatever is most available. To the right of each player is 
            the place where scores are kept and tallied.
        </p>
        <h5>Play</h5>
        <p>
            The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes in their side. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in 
            each hole until the pieces run out. If you run into your own tally place, deposit one piece in it, and continue. If the last piece you drop is in your own store, 
            you get another turn. If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite. 
            Always place all captured pieces in your store.
        </p>
        <h5>Winning</h5>
        <p>
            The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the board are empty. The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends capures all of those 
            pieces. And then, surprise! The player with the most pieces wins.
        </p>
